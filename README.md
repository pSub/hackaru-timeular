# hackaru-timeular
Track your time with the Timeular cube and Hackaru

**Notice**: This project is no longer actively developed as the development of Hackaru was stopped in November 2022. I still use it until I have a different setup. However, do not count on security
or other updates for `hackaru-timeular`. I will archive this repository as soon I switch to a different setup.

## Motivation

Timeular (https://timeular.com/) offers a hardware and a software component that helps you to keep track of your time. The great thing is, that you can use the hardware without their software. I really like the idea of the hardware cube. It simply is physically present right besides you. When using the Timeular cube, it is rare that I forget to start or stop the timer for a task. If you want to learn more about the tracker, visit https://timeular.com/tracker/.

I have not looked into the time tracking software from Timeular as I already have a Hackaru which works really well for me. This led to the creation of `hackaru-timeular`, a small Python program that connects a Timeular cube to Hackaru.

## Installation

`hackaru-timeular` is available via PiPy and can be installed as simple as `pip install hackaru-timeular`.

## Configuration

`hackaru-timeular` is configured in the configuration file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hackaru-timeular/config.yml`.

The following example shows how to configure `hackaru-timeular` to connect to your Timeular cube and a Hackaru instance.
